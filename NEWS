TODOs

Examples: RcppExports fun/arg parsing.

Should we try to eliminate non-capturing groups when they are not necessary?
e.g. below the only thing in the inside non-capturing group is a capturing group,
so the inside non-capturing group could be removed.

2020.10.6

New internal functions measure_single, measure_multiple, melt_list,
check_names, check_df_names.

capture_melt_single/multiple now use data.table::melt with new
variable_table attribute of measure.vars (more efficient than previous
join approach).

capture_melt_multiple with group named "count" works now.

New exported function nc::measure for use as measure.vars argument of
melt. Multiple value columns output if there is a group named "column"
and single value column output otherwise. Main difference with
capture_melt_* functions is that using melt+nc::measure directly has
less error checking, e.g., could result in data.table using make.names
to create unique names, if value.name=one of the group names.

2020.9.27

capture_melt_multiple(fill=TRUE)

Move helper functions from README to vignette 5.

New more informative/helpful error message for capture_melt_* when
some columns match but they are converted to NA by the type conversion
functions.

capture_melt_multiple(na.rm=TRUE) works even when there are entire
groups which are missing (actually nc code did NOT change, bug fix was
in data.table).

PROVEDIt data with 100 peaks x 3 features per peak columns to melt.

2020.8.6

data.table::fread version 1.13.0 now gives IDate instead of character,
thanks to @MichaelChirico for updating test-CRAN-multiple.R

New test for default/specified engine via features that only work with
ICU (verbose character classes) and PCRE (recursion). Old test used
non-representable characters which did not work on windows (but did
work on Ubuntu).

Suggest markdown for vignettes.

2020.7.1

nc::capture_* functions were using a named argument starting with "s"
as the subject argument, which was confusing since the first argument
should be the subject, and it is never named. Fixed by removing
subject argument and instead taking subject from the first element of
... (in capture_df_names and new subject_var_args function).

Various documentation clarifications.

2020.5.16

Clarify some docs.

2019.8.22

DESCRIPTION updated.

Informative error for named character string patterns.

2019.8.21

main functions renamed to capture_* for auto-complete convenience.

on https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/issues/279 it says ICU >= 59 is
required for emoji support. but travis uses Ubuntu xenial system ICU
(55.1) by default. Ubuntu bionic has ICU 60.2
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+source/icu so travis build will
most likely be fixed by telling travis to use bionic. Actually dist:
bionic builds use xenial still for language: r,
https://travis-ci.community/t/for-dist-bionic-xenial-vm-is-used-instead-with-language-rust/4487/2
So instead we fix the build by making if interactive() for this
example, and adding another engine="ICU" example based on
http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp for str_capture_all.

FIXED: needed to escape backslashes in examples.
Executing example(vec_capture_first) gives
> vec_capture_first(
+ "a\U0001F60E#",
+ emoji="\p{EMOJI_Presentation}",
Erreur : '\p' est un code escape non reconnu dans une chaîne de caractères débutant ""\p"
(but executing the example from C-c C-c in R/vec_capture_first.R works fine)

2019.8.14

first version forked from namedCapture.

vec_capture_first, str_capture_all, df_capture_first pass tests for
three engines: ICU, PCRE, RE2.
