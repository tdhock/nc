Examples: RcppExports fun/arg parsing.

capture_melt_multiple(fill=TRUE) for adding NA entries for missing
columns? are there any compelling use cases?

Should we try to eliminate non-capturing groups when they are not necessary?
e.g. below the only thing in the inside non-capturing group is a capturing group,
so the inside non-capturing group could be removed.

on https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/issues/279 it says ICU >= 59 is
required for emoji support. but travis uses Ubuntu xenial system ICU
(55.1) by default. Ubuntu bionic has ICU 60.2
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+source/icu so travis build will
most likely be fixed by telling travis to use bionic. Actually dist:
bionic builds use xenial still for language: r,
https://travis-ci.community/t/for-dist-bionic-xenial-vm-is-used-instead-with-language-rust/4487/2
So instead we fix the build by making if interactive() for this
example, and adding another engine="ICU" example based on
http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp for str_capture_all.
