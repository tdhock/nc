Changes in version 2024.1.31

- Remove code which uses old pre-measure data.table.
- Fix eurostat URL in vignette 3.

Changes in version 2024.1.4

- new vignette v7-capture-glob.

Changes in version 2023.8.24

- provide argument descriptions for un-exported functions (required to avoid NOTE on CRAN using new R-devel).
- data.table::setDTthreads(1) in examples and tests to avoid CRAN NOTE.
- examples fread plain text instead of gz files, to save time on CRAN.

Changes in version 2023.5.1

- melt uses variable_table if data.table has measure.
- VignetteEngine knitr -> rmarkdown.

Changes in version 2023.3.30

- new arrow hive partition example for capture_first_glob.

Changes in version 2023.1.10

- new function capture_first_glob.

Changes in version 2021.11.30

- capture_first_vec: when there are more than 10 subjects which do not match, error message only shows first 5 and last 5 indices (instead of all indices as previously). Uses new collapse_some function (internal use only; also used in check_names).

Changes in version 2021.11.17

- alternatives_with_shared_groups.

Changes in version 2021.7.16

- Suggest re2 instead of re2r.

Changes in version 2021.6.28

- capture_first_df has new existing.error argument, default TRUE same as existing behavior (error when capture group name same as column name in subject), FALSE means to overwrite existing column (useful when experimenting with regex that modifies DT).

Changes in version 2021.6.25

- capture_first_df uses data.table::set when input is data table, for memory efficiency. Entire table is still copied if input is data frame.
- capture_melt_multiple example for fill=TRUE.

Changes in version 2021.6.23

- apply_type_funs stops for NA to non-NA conversion.

Changes in version 2021.5.20

- new capture_longer_spec function.

Changes in version 2021.4.2

- New v0-overview vignette.

Changes in version 2021.3.31

- Duplicate capture group names now allowed in alternatives.
- New function altlist which helps when defining alternatives with common sub-patterns.

Changes in version 2020.10.6

- New error for capture_melt_multiple with only one input variable per value captured in column group.
- New internal functions measure_single, measure_multiple, melt_list, check_names, check_df_names.
- capture_melt_single/multiple now use data.table::melt with new variable_table attribute of measure.vars (more efficient than previous join approach). Therefore Imports changed to require at least version 

Changes in version 2020.9.27

- capture_melt_multiple(fill=TRUE)
- Move helper functions from README to vignette 5.
- New more informative/helpful error message for capture_melt_* when some columns match but they are converted to NA by the type conversion functions.
- capture_melt_multiple(na.rm=TRUE) works even when there are entire groups which are missing (actually nc code did NOT change, bug fix was in data.table).
- PROVEDIt data with 100 peaks x 3 features per peak columns to melt.

Changes in version 2020.8.6

- data.table::fread version 1.13.0 now gives IDate instead of character, thanks to @MichaelChirico for updating test-CRAN-multiple.R
- New test for default/specified engine via features that only work with ICU (verbose character classes) and PCRE (recursion). Old test used non-representable characters which did not work on windows (but did work on Ubuntu).
- Suggest markdown for vignettes.

Changes in version 2020.7.1

- nc::capture_* functions were using a named argument starting with "s" as the subject argument, which was confusing since the first argument should be the subject, and it is never named. Fixed by removing subject argument and instead taking subject from the first element of ... (in capture_df_names and new subject_var_args function).
- Various documentation clarifications.

Changes in version 2020.5.16

- Clarify some docs.

Changes in version 2020.5.14

- fix typo in capture_melt_single example.
- stop_for_engine tells user to get re2r from github.

Changes in version 2020.3.23

- reduce repetition in tests, test_engines defined in a separate inst/test_engines.R file.

Changes in version 2020.2.27

- PROVEDit file names example in capture first vignette.
- alternatives(pattern1, pattern2, ...) generates pattern1|pattern2, with support for named arguments.

Changes in version 2020.2.24

- capture_melt_multiple bugfix when "count" is one of the columns to output.

Changes in version 2020.1.16

- test for pattern with literal groups.

Changes in version 2019.12.12

-     Warning in deparse(e[[2L]]) :      it is not known that wchar_t is Unicode on this platform

Changes in version 2019.9.28

- capture_first_melt_multiple inspired by data.table::patterns.
- capture_first_melt inspired by tidyr::pivot_longer.

Changes in version 2019.9.4

- engine error message includes install.packages.

- dput used for did you mean error message.
- vignettes separated, 1=first 2=all.

Changes in version 2019.8.22

- DESCRIPTION updated.
- Informative error for named character string patterns.

Changes in version 2019.8.21

- main functions renamed to capture_* for auto-complete convenience.
- on https://github.com/gagolews/stringi/issues/279 it says ICU >= 59 is required for emoji support. but travis uses Ubuntu xenial system ICU (55.1) by default. Ubuntu bionic has ICU 60.2 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+source/icu so travis build will most likely be fixed by telling travis to use bionic. Actually dist: bionic builds use xenial still for language: r, https://travis-ci.community/t/for-dist-bionic-xenial-vm-is-used-instead-with-language-rust/4487/2 So instead we fix the build by making if interactive() for this example, and adding another engine="ICU" example based on http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp for str_capture_all.
- docs.
- vignette.
- FIXED: needed to escape backslashes in examples. 

Changes in version 2019.8.14

- first version forked from namedCapture.
- vec_capture_first, str_capture_all, df_capture_first pass tests for three engines: ICU, PCRE, RE2.
