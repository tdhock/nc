User-friendly functions for extracting a data
table (row for each match, column for each group)
from non-tabular text data using regular expressions,
and for melting/reshaping columns that match a regular expression.

|----------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------------------+-------------------------|
| Single string        | =capture_all_str=       | =stringr::str_match_all=              | =rex::re_matches=       |

| File paths           | =capture_first_glob=    | =arrow::open_dataset=                 |                         |

- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v0-overview.html][Vignette 0]] provides an overview of the various functions.
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v1-capture-first.html][Vignette 1]] discusses =capture_first_vec= and =capture_first_df=, which capture the first match in each of
  several subjects (character vector, data frame character columns).
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v2-capture-all.html][Vignette 2]] discusses =capture_all_str= which captures all matches in
  a single string, or a single multi-line text file. The vignette also
  shows how to use =capture_all_str= on several different
  strings/files, using data.table =by= syntax.
- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v3-capture-melt.html][Vignette 3]] discusses =capture_melt_single= and
  =capture_melt_multiple= which match a regex to the column names of a
  wide data frame, then melt/reshape the matching columns. These functions are
  especially useful when more than one separate piece of information
  can be captured from each column name, e.g. the iris column names
  =Petal.Width=, =Sepal.Width=, etc each have two pieces of
  information (flower part and measurement dimension).

- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v5-helpers.html][Vignette 5]] explains how to use helper functions for creating complex
  regular expressions.

- [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v7-capture-glob.html][Vignette 7]] explains how to read regularly named files, and use a
  regex to extract meta-data from the file names, using
  =nc::capture_first_glob=.

*** Choice of regex engine

By default, nc uses PCRE. Other options include ICU and RE2.

To tell nc that you would like to use a certain engine, 
#+BEGIN_SRC R
options(nc.engine="RE2")
#+END_SRC

Every function also has an engine argument, e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  nc::capture_first_vec(
    "foo a\U0001F60E# bar",
    before=".*?",
    emoji="\\p{EMOJI_Presentation}",
    after=".*",
    engine="ICU")
  #>   before emoji after
  #> 1  foo a     ðŸ˜Ž # bar
#+END_SRC

For an detailed comparison of regex C libraries in R (ICU, PCRE,
TRE, RE2), see my [[https://github.com/tdhock/namedCapture-article][R journal (2019) paper about namedCapture]].

The nc reshaping functions provide functionality similar to packages
tidyr, stats, data.table, reshape, reshape2, cdata, utils, etc. The
main difference is that =nc::capture_melt_*= support named capture
regular expressions with type conversion, which (1) makes it easier to
create/maintain a complex regex, and (2) results in less repetition in
user code. For a detailed comparison, see [[https://github.com/tdhock/nc-article][my R Journal (2021) paper
about nc]].
  
Below I list the main
differences between the functions in =nc= and other analogous R functions:
- Main =nc= functions all have the =capture_= prefix for easy auto-completion.
- Output in =nc= is always a data.table (other packages output either
  a list, character matrix, or data frame).
- For memory efficiency, =nc::capture_first_df= modifies the input if
  it is a data table, whereas =tidyr= functions always
  copy the input table.
- By default the =nc::capture_first_vec= stops with an error if any
  subjects do not match, whereas other functions
  return NA/missing rows.
- =nc::capture_all_str= only supports capturing multiple matches in a
  single subject (returning a data table), whereas other functions support
  multiple subjects (and return list of character matrices).
  For handling multiple subjects using =nc=,
  use =DT[, nc::capture_all_str(subject), by]=
  (see [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v2-capture-all.html][vignette 2]] for more info).
- =nc::capture_melt_single= and =nc::capture_melt_multiple= use regex
  for wide-to-tall data reshaping, see [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v3-capture-melt.html][Vignette 3]] and my [[https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-029/index.html][R Journal
  (2021)]] paper for more info. Whereas in nc these are two separate
  functions, other packages typically provide a single function which
  does both kinds of reshaping, for example [[https://rdrr.io/github/Rdatatable/data.table/man/measure.html][measure]] in =data.table=.
- =nc::capture_first_glob= is for reading any kind of regularly named
  files into R using regex, whereas =arrow::open_dataset= requires a
  particular naming scheme (does not support regex).
- Helper function =nc::measure= can be used to create the
  =measure.vars= argument of =data.table::melt=, and
  =nc::capture_longer_spec= can be used to create the =spec= argument
  of =tidyr::pivot_longer=. This can be useful if you want to use nc
  to define the regex, but you want to use the other package functions
  to do the reshape.
- Similar to [[https://github.com/r-lib/rex/blob/main/R/capture.R][rex::capture]], helper function =nc::field= is provided for
  defining patterns that match subjects like variable=value, and
  create a column/group named variable (useful to avoid repeating
  variable names in regex code). See [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v2-capture-all.html][vignette 2]] for more info.
- Similar to [[https://github.com/r-lib/rex/blob/main/R/or.R][rex::or]], =nc::alternatives_with_shared_groups= is
  provided for defining a pattern containing alternatives with shared
  groups. See [[https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/nc/vignettes/v5-helpers.html][vignette 5]] for more info.
